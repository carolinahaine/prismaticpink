            <h2>My bag</h2>      
<p>I have always liked seeing people's bags on 2000s websites. Sadly I was too young to own anything interesting to show lol, but here we are, 20 years later, fulfilling that dream!</p>
<p>You might notice my bags have small keychains. I want to get bigger purse pals, maybe in the future? <s>I'm not a fan of Labubu, btw.</s></p>

<p>Speaking of dreams, an OG <strong>Cambridge Satchel</strong> was definitely one of them! My initial plan was getting the Vintage one, but this one was on sale and I quite like the navy and red combination. It's the 13 inch one, so it doesn't fit a laptop, but the 15 inch one was too big for my taste.</p>

<p>This <strong>Kate Spade</strong> is the bag you'll see me using most of the time when I don't need to carry my iPad, headphones, or books. I use it when I leave the house quickly and I basically just need my documents, or when I'm travelling. Just a small bag every girl needs. lol</p>

<p>11 out of 10 women in Europe own one of these! It's also very convenient for travelling because it's foldable. I wanted to get a pink one, but it was limited edition. *cries*</p>
